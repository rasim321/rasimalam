A text generator for the Song of Ice and Fire (if GRRM won't finish his books, we must take it upon ourselves to do so)

Training GPT-2 on the first book of a Song of Ice and Fire to generate new text for impatient fans of the series.

** Example prompt: "A Lannister always" **

>Generated Text: "A Lannister always pays his debts, not for his own time… to the lord or the woman.” Varys sighed as Catelyn smiled, slipping uncertainly from her chair. “What if Gregor didn’t ask? Damn him. Just as treason falls.” “Tell him he was lying, to the council or the king?” Cersei rose. “There’s more to that than show, if it’s true. Lysa will send the queen back to Dragonstone, her own womb in her womb and keep the baby at her side. She wants to see her father, to see his joy, to see his company, to see Marillion the warm courtesies who are hard-pressed to keep them.” “The truth is, little sister,” Varys said. “If truth be told, then truth be told, the Lord Commander"

** Example Prompt: "Jon Snow" **

>Generated Text: Jon Snow?” Jon saw the king’s face, blind and speechless. He had never seen a man so beautiful. “I’ll send him back to the Eyrie,” Jon told him. “If I had, I’d sooner send them to Winterfell instead.” Ned would send word to his brother and to Winterfell and all the realm at once.

But it was not often that the king looked up to him with a glance at the Seven Kingdoms. It was seldom that when he saw the faces of men like Snow, he thought. He saw the faces of men like his own, men like old men who looked up to him in desperate hope. The dragons did not wait for him. He saw the faces of men"

** Example prompt: "Cersei sat on the iron throne" **

>Generated Text: Cersei sat on the iron throne, silent and melancholy, drinking wine from a cup he had left for the khalasar. “Lady Stark, I am pleased to know that you have been found.” “Very well,” Ned said. “I shall not forget it,” Catelyn said. She was seated on the iron throne, surrounded by her husband’s knights. “We are not to leave this chamber empty-handed, you have vowed to my love and honor.” “Is that understood, then?” Ser Rodrik said. “I would not betray your king, Catelyn,” she said. Catelyn had never loved a king before. She had always loved the khalasar, she knew it, and she knew it from her own heart. It was hard to lie so alone. “The khalasar is a sacred place."
