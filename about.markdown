# Briefly, 

I'm a data scientist and researcher interested in engaging with policy challlenges at scale with data science. I graduated from Harvard Kennedy School where I studied tech policy and machine learning. At Harvard, I taught my classmates data literacy, programming, and communicating with data as a teaching assistant and as part of the data science club.

Most recently, I wrote about the challenges and opportunities that frontier technology presents to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. You can read it on the United Nations Conference of Trade and Development site [here](https://unctad.org/system/files/information-document/CSTD2020-2021_Issues02_Blockchain_rev_en.pdf). Last summer, I worked at The Future Society on a project that uses AI to deliver accurate and timely information on Covid-19. It's called the [CAIAC](https://thefuturesociety.org/2020/07/28/caiac-alliance-launch/) project.

I received a BA in Economics and International Relations from Tufts University in 2017.

Currently, I'm looking to work with mission-driven organizations in data science and analytics. You can find my resume [here.](files\web_resume.pdf)
