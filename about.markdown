# Briefly, 

I'm a data scientist and researcher who is interested in both the technical (how to machine learning) and policy side (why to machine learning) of frontier technology. I graduated from Harvard Kennedy School where I studied tech policy and data science. At Harvard, I taught my classmates data literacy, programming, and communicating with data as a teaching assistant and as President of the data science club.

Most recently, I wrote about the challenges and opportunities that frontier technology presents to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals. You can read it on the United Nations Conference of Trade and Development site [here](https://unctad.org/system/files/information-document/CSTD2020-2021_Issues02_Blockchain_rev_en.pdf). Last summer, I worked at The Future Society on a project that uses AI to deliver accurate and timely information on Covid-19. It's called the [CAIAC](https://thefuturesociety.org/2020/07/28/caiac-alliance-launch/) project.

I received a BA in Economics and International Relations from Tufts University in 2017.

I enjoy employing data science and machine learning methods to the social sciences. Currently, I'm looking to work with mission-driven organizations in data science and analytics. You can find my resume here.
